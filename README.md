# ThoraxAI

This project aims to be a multi-phase AI agent that can analyze Chest X-Rays (CXRs) to detect the presence of different conditions that are diagnosable through the use of CXRs. The phases are planned as such:

1. A binary CNN that can detect the presence of pneumonia
2. Detection of which lobe the pneumonia is in
3. Detection of lung cancer and other conditions
4. Inclusion of a heatmap to determine the location of the CXR anomaly

This project is for research and educational purposes only and is not intended for clinical use.
