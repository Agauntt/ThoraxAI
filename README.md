# ThoraxAI
ThoraxAI is a multi-label chest X-ray pathology classifier using transfer learning from ResNet, with Grad-CAM explainability for anomaly localization. It is an explainable AI (XAI) built in four phases -
			1) Binary detection of pneumonia
			2) Localized detection of the affected lobe
			3) Multi-condition detection
      4) Layering of Grad-CAM heatmaps for anomaly localization


This is meant to showcase my passion for both the clinical and technical side of medical AI. As a kinesiologist, software engineer, and former clinical research technician, I bring a unique mix of skills to this field that I hold in such high regard

This project is for research and educational purposes only and is not intended for clinical use.
